Team CYB3RL4NG is an undergraduate research team that is part of the Gemstone Program at the University of Maryland.
Our goal is to study semantic bleaching of mental health terms used online.

## Research Question

How has the internet affected the use of language? This is a question that has sent Team CYB3RL4NG into its current direction. The internet has rapidly increased the flow of information from one person to another, and from one place to another. Language patterns are beginning to spread at faster rates than we could have ever predicted due to the growth of the internet. 

As different uses of language spread more rapidly throughout the internet, we begin to see the popularization of different words and concepts to mainstream audiences. Wider populations have adopted political lingo, medical terms, and other jargon previously contained to small subsections of people. Yet, when complex concepts are introduced to a wider and more diverse range of people, are they able to maintain the weight and nuance of these topics?

Team CYB3RL4NG aims to explore this concept with mental health terminology coined by professionals in the field of psychology. Mental health is a topic that has gained prominence in popular discourse as of recent years, but as is the nature of the internet, these conversations become oversaturated through the constant flow of information. Certain concepts in psychological discourse become spread more and more widely, but the weight of these concepts can become lost in the process. Team CYB3RL4NG wishes to explore the chronology by which terms in psychological discourse become popularized, and whether the popularization of these terms has resulted in a dilution of their meanings and weight.

## Methodology

We will download comments from all of Reddit and use embeddings and co-word analysis to study semantic bleaching.

Here's the Gemstone and the Honors College logos, because Gemstone asked us to put them there.
They were mildly annoying to center. It would also be nice if the fill inside the g
were transparent too, to match the background outside. Would be even better if
we'd gotten an SVG of the logo, so we could change the foreground too. We should
probably contact Gemstone about that but we don't feel like it so we'll just leave this
up until one of us objects to it. We totally appreciate Gemstone, though. The program
is slay and gorg and stuff. Ellicott sucks, though. We heard a rumor that Gemstone
had the chance to move into one of the new buildings near Yahentamitsi but the Gemstone
staff to chose to stay in Ellicott because they didn't feel like moving. Is that true?
Because if it is, we are rather disappointed in you guys. Ellicott felt more like a mental
asylum than a real dorm, literally every place was super cramped, especially the
basement rooms, and the lack of A/C did not help (and we know everyone's like "oh
it's actually an advantage because everyone goes out of their rooms and makes friends"
but we did not come here to make friends. We came because we were unable to get into
ACES and our parents still wanted us to go to an honors program, any honors program,
because it would supposedly help get jobs or whatever, so we yielded (like we always do,
we don't know if it's an Indian parent thing or what but it's harder to move them than
the doors at Iribe (although maybe that's only hard to do because we're out of shape))
and ended up going into Gemstone because it was the only one vaguely aligned with our interests). If
we had to list a single bad thing about Ellicott, we would be unable to, because
we would either freeze up trying to find the worst of the infinite list of problems
with Ellicott, or we would unleash a string of obscenities while also trying to
enumerate that infinite list, unable to stop after just one bad thing.

We still appreciate Gemstone though ðŸ’ž. Also, thanks for the money, we really appreciate it.
