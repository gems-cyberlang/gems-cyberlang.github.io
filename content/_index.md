Team CYB3RL4NG is an undergraduate research team at the University of Maryland. Our goal is to analyze trends in internet slang.

## Research Problem

"The internet" as a construct is not a monolith, and to understand how language has evolved online, it is important to understand the technical aspects of communication users have had to accommodate for, as well as changing demographics and evolving uses of the internet. Current social media is a series of interconnected platforms that aim to incorporate as many elements as possible, such as text, image, emoji, audio, and video, instead of just one of two. Older, forum style social media has mostly become obsolete, with the exception of Reddit, and blogging and vlogging have lost popularity. The T9 system, Twitter character limits, l337 speak, and forum-threading, are all examples of informal language in online spaces/dependent on digital context that have had long standing effects on how we communicate online (respectively: incorporating more numbers for faster typing speed, more acronyms to fit character limits, using stylistic spellings to avoid censorship, and the replacement of traditional lexical referents with the “@” feature.) Even with the introduction of sticky keyboards and increased flexibility in methods of communication, slang and grammatical standards from past eras have carried over.
